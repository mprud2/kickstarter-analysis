# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends (Module 1 Assignment)
### Goal of analysis is to provide customer with insights that will assist in planning a successful Kickstarter campaign for their play.

## Analysis and Challenges
Data was parsed to look at outcomes for plays depending on when the Kickstarter campaign was launched and how high the stated funding goal was.  The dataset itself was challenging because it included Kickstarter projects that may not be relevant to this particular effort (i.e. not all the data was restricted to theatrical plays).  An effort was made to exclude categories of data that are not relevant to this particular Kickstarter.  The dataset itself appeared to be pretty "clean", and did not contain any noticeable misspellings or typos.  

One of the identified discrepancies/challenges of this dataset is that the different Kickstarter campaigns were not all normalized to the same monetary unit.  This could create miscategorization of some campaigns when they were separated into categories based on the pledged goal (i.e. a campaign in Great Britain and the US may be improperly compared depending on what the exchange rate was at the time of the Kickstarter).
